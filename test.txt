          u"Chad: Abigail, this is pathetic. You had a paternity test. You told me \r\nyourself that I wasn't your baby's father. This is beneath you. ",

          u'Kate: Well, according to your standards, I suppose it was. ',
          u"Nicole: Is that fun for you? Do you think putting us down keeps you in the \r\ndriver's seat? Let me tell you something, woman, you are wrong. Tonight was a \r\ndream come true for us, and we are not gonna let you or anyone else turn it into \r\na nightmare. ",

          u'John: I did? ',
          u'Marlena: You did. I was proud of you. And now you can put all that behind \r\nyou, because this is officially a new year. A brand new year. Especially a new \r\nyear for the two of us. ',
          u"Kayla: Let's get him to room two. ",
          u"Fynn: I'll get the last one. Daniel. Was he breathing when you got to him?\r\n",

          u'JJ: No, you were a natural. You killed it. Rocked the house. ',
          u"Gabi: Don't go overboard. ",
          u'JJ: I\'m not. No, seriously, when you walked out in that dress, all I was \r\nthinking to myself was, "when the show\'s over, I\'m walking out with her." ',
          u'Abigail: Do you really think that I am that pathetic? That I would lie about \r\nmy son being sick? ',
          u'Chad: Oh, come on. ',
          u'Abigail: Listen to me. I had to wake him up to feed him this morning. He \r\nwould barely nurse at all. He was pale and he was listless, and those are all \r\nsigns of aplastic anemia, which is something I had when I was a baby. ',
          u"Chad: So, he had a rotten morning. You want me to believe he has aplastic \r\nanemia? You can't use a kid like that, Abigail. ",
          u"Abigail: Are you kidding me? Do you really think that I am that desperate? \r\nYou think that I would-- I would invent some illness about my son just to try to \r\nget you back? I'm here because my son--our son's life might depend on it. ",
          u"Chad: Don't-- ",
          u"Abigail: Yeah, Chad, our son. So why don't you step up? Because your son \r\nneeds you. ",
          u"Maggie: I don't think I can drink to that. ",
          u'Victor: Why not? ',
          u'Maggie: I think you have an ulterior motive. ',
          u'Victor: Me? ',
          u"Maggie: I know that you know it's somewhat uncomfortable for me, having \r\nCaroline here. ",
          u'Victor: But you were so decent about it when I told you I had to protect her.\r\n',
          u"Maggie: And you were right. Caroline does need protecting, and she's Bo's \r\nmother, so how could I not be decent? ",
          u"Victor: I just want you to know, that you're the one I think of when I go to \r\nsleep at night, and you're the one I think of when I get up in the morning. How \r\na cantankerous old man like me got a lady like you, I'll never know, but here we \r\nare at the dawn of a new year, and I'm looking forward to spending it all with \r\nyou. You're my inspiration. ",

          u'Abigail: Excuse me? ',
          u"Chad: What, I'm just supposed to buy all of this? Without a shred of medical \r\nevidence? ",
          u"Abigail: No, Chad! Why don't you come to the hospital yourself, okay? Will \r\nthat make you feel better? Come and look at all the blood work, the charts. You \r\ncan see everything-- ",
          u'Chad: Okay, what is that gonna prove? Even if he has this, uh, anemia thing, \r\nhe got it from you! ',
          u"Abigail: We liked at Ben's blood also just to make sure that there was \r\nnothing on his side. And when the test results came back, they showed that Ben \r\nand Thomas are not genetically related. That is a fact, Chad. It is also a fact \r\nthat you are the only other man I slept with, so unless you want to accuse me of \r\nlying about that also... ",
          u'Chad: No. ',
          u'Abigail: Your son needs you. And you know what? To tell you the truth, I \r\ncould really use your support also. What happened to you? You used to talk about \r\nus being a family, the three of us-- you, me, and Thomas. ',
          u"Gabi: So you thought we'd be leaving together? You're very sure of yourself, \r\naren't you? ",
          u"JJ: No, no, no. I didn't mean-- ",
          u"Gabi: I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Listen, um, the models are \r\nhaving a little get-together after-show party, and I was hoping you'd want to \r\ncome with me. ",
          u"JJ: To a party with you and a room full of models? [Sighs] I'm sorry. I just--I got some other plans. I'm kidding. ",
          u'Gabi: Okay. ',
          u'JJ: Just let me talk to my mom, yeah? She worries. ',
          u"Gabi: That's very sweet of you. So are you. ",
          u"JJ: Hey, mom. Um, it's me. Uh, I'm just with Gabi right now and we're gonna \r\nbe going to this party for a little while. Um, but if you're still up, just \r\ndon't worry. ",
          u'Gabi: So we should get going. ',
          u"JJ: Yeah, but there's just something I've been wanting to do first. Something \r\nthat I've actually been wanting to do all night. ",
          u"Gabi: What's that? ",
          u'Kate: I admit that I was pretty tough on both of you. I tried speaking as the \r\nvoice of the company and I suppose that could have seemed like I was taking all \r\nthe credit. ',
          u'Nicole: There are three voices in this company. ',
          u'Theresa: And you did take all the credit. ',
          u'Kate: And if the evening had been a disaster, I would have taken \r\nresponsibility for that as well. ',
          u'Theresa: Oh, yeah? Well, we only have your word on that. ',
          u"Kate: I wouldn't have liked it, I hate admitting failure, but I would have \r\ndone it. Because the truth is... I'm terrified of failure. ",
          u'Nicole: So you covered by being an arrogant know-it-all? ',
          u'Kate: Pretty much. ',
